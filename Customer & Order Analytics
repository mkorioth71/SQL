#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID), product
FROM JanSales
WHERE product = 'iPhone' 
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct acctnum 
FROM customers cust 
INNER JOIN FebSales Feb 
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid 
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct product, price 
FROM JanSales 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1; 

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT ROUND(SUM(Quantity*price))AS 'Total Revenue', product
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each 
SELECT product, quantity, SUM(Quantity*price) AS 'Total Revenue'
FROM FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount s
SELECT COUNT(customers.acctnum), AVG(FebSales.price*FebSales.Quantity) AS 'Total Spent'
FROM FebSales
LEFT JOIN customers
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE FebSales.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
